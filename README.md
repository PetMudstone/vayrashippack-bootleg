# vayrashippack-bootleg

GitHub repo for hosting releases of my Starsector 0.96 bootleg of Vayra's Ship Pack, as done with Vayra's permission.

There isn't any source code here available, this is just so that there's a version of Vayra's Ship Pack available that works well enough for 0.96 thanks to changes I made to ship and weapon spawning.
